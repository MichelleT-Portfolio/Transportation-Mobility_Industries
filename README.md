## 🚴‍♂️ Bike-Sharing Expansion: Pedaling Towards Smarter Cities!

### Project Overview

Imagine a world where hopping on a bike is as easy as ordering your favorite coffee. Well, it’s happening! Bike-sharing systems are transforming urban mobility, reducing congestion, and promoting eco-friendly travel. But, what if we could make them even better?


This project dives into data-driven insights to optimize bike-sharing programs, ensuring that bikes are available where and when people need them the most. Using machine learning magic ✨, we uncover trends, predict demand, and create smarter strategies to keep the wheels spinning!

### Objective:
To assist a bike-sharing company in optimizing operations, expanding customer outreach, and improving service efficiency using predictive analytics.

### Approach:
- Analyzed historical data on bike rentals based on weather, weekends, holidays, and other variables.
- Implemented ensemble learning techniques (Bagging, Boosting, and Stacking) to predict demand trends.
- Identified key factors affecting rental volume to improve resource allocation.

### 💡 Key Insights & Recommendations

• Weather matters! ☀️🌧️ Adjust bike availability based on seasonal and weather forecasts.

• Location, location, location! 🏢 More bikes should be placed near offices, colleges, and transit hubs.

• Timing is everything! ⏳ Surge pricing and bike redistribution should be optimized based on peak hours.

• Subscription perks! 👥 Encourage ridership with monthly passes, discounts, and referral bonuses.

• Maintenance at night! 🎨 Since usage dips after dark, schedule repairs and rebalancing efficiently.



## 🛣 Airline Sentiment Analysis: Decoding Passenger Emotions

### Project Overview

Picture this: You just landed after a long-haul flight, and your luggage is nowhere to be found. Naturally, you vent on Twitter! Airlines today receive a flood of customer feedback online, but how can they keep up with it all?

Enter AI-driven sentiment analysis! 🌟 This project leverages NLP models to analyze tweets, detect customer sentiment (positive, negative, neutral), and provide airlines with actionable insights to boost customer satisfaction and prevent PR disasters.

### Objective:
To develop a Generative AI application that automates the classification and prioritization of customer support tickets, improving response efficiency and customer satisfaction.

### Approach:
- Leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) and sentiment analysis to classify ticket categories, assign priorities, and generate automated responses.
- Structured feedback data to optimize issue resolution processes.
- Developed an AI-driven system to predict estimated resolution times based on ticket type.

)

## 🔎 Key Insights & Recommendations

• “Delayed” is the new four-letter word ⚡️ - Flight delays dominate negative feedback.

• Happy flyers = happy airlines 🚀 Customers appreciate great service, so reward exceptional crew performance.

• Real-time response = saved reputation ✉️ Implement AI-powered chatbots to address complaints instantly.

• Data-driven decisions 📊 Identify recurring pain points (baggage, delays, service) and fix them proactively.

• Engage, don’t just react! 👥 Airlines should interact with customers online, turning complaints into loyalty-building moments.


# 🛍️ Customer Ticket Feedback Analysis: AI to the Rescue!



## Project Overview

Ever been stuck waiting for a customer service response? 😡 Well, businesses are drowning in support tickets, and manually sorting them is so last decade!


This project introduces an AI-powered system using Generative AI & Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate ticket classification, priority setting, and even response generation!

### Objective:
To analyze social media feedback, specifically customer reviews on Twitter, to assess sentiment trends and identify key drivers of satisfaction and dissatisfaction.

### Approach:
- Developed a predictive sentiment analysis model using Google FLAN-T5, achieving an 82% accuracy rate.
- Identified frequent negative keywords (e.g., "delayed," "cancelled," "customer service") and positive keywords (e.g., "thank," "great," "appreciate").
- Built word clouds to visualize common topics associated with different sentiment types.
